# Multi Source Random Walk Graph Traversal. 

This repository contains the code for ongoing research aiming to improve preformance
of Random Walk procedure for Graph Embeddings.

The basis for this research are following papers:

    node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks 
    Grover, Aditya and Leskovec, Jure
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00653
    
and

    The More the Merrier: Efficient Multi-Source Graph Traversal
    Then, Kaufmann, Chirigati, Hoang-Vuâ€ , Pham, Kemper, Neumann, Vo

## Code Description
Will be published after research is finalized.
